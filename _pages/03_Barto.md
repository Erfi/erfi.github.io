The following subsections contain code and graphs that are prepared from [Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/the-book.html).

They include some graphs which are replica of the ones illustrated in the book and some other graphs that are part of the exercises or my own experiments for better underestanding the material such as the effect of changing parameters on the final results.
